Description of the project:
Developing Academic Search Engine using C++ and Qt. This project intends to create a search engine 
that will search for resources in USC like publications, research papers, journals, conference proceedings, etc.
We want to use the qt framework to create a simple UI over the C++ application.

Features:
The developed system supports the following features:
•	This system supports full title search, partial title search, and keyword-based search, with no restriction 
	on improper spacing or incorrect case of alphabets
•	Partial title with the relative order of words maintained returns accurate results at the top of the list of results
•	Keyword has to be spelled properly in the title search, other words may have some wrong spellings with the relative 
	order of words maintained 
•	Returns results in the form of URL and clicking on this URL can open the research article
•	To display search results the user has to type at least one keyword correctly in the search bar
•	For partial title or multiple keyword-based searches from a user, the closest results displayed earlier
	(higher in the page) in the list of results displayed
