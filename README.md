## Description of the project:
	Develop an academic search engine using C++ and Qt framework. This project intends to create a search engine 
	that will search for resources in USC like publications, research papers, journals, conference proceedings, etc.
	Use the Qt framework to create a simple UI over the C++ application.

## Features:
	The developed system supports the following features:
		•	This system supports full title search, partial title search, and keyword-based search, with no restriction 
		on improper spacing or incorrect case of alphabets
		•	Partial title with the relative order of words maintained returns accurate results at the top of the list of results
		•	Keyword has to be spelled properly in the title search, other words may have some wrong spellings with the relative 
			order of words maintained 
		•	Returns results in the form of URL and clicking on this URL can open the research article
		•	To display search results the user has to type at least one keyword correctly in the search bar
		•	For partial title or multiple keyword-based searches from a user, the closest results displayed earlier
		(higher in the page) in the list of results displayed
